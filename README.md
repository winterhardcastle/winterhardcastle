### Hi, I'm Winter Hardcastle
<!-- description-start -->
NYC based Full Stack Software Engineer, Maker, Multidisciplinary Technology Enthusiast.

I take great enjoyment in creating things that excite people. Whether that be software or hardware, designing with a "wow" user experience in mind helps me make beautiful things. My introduction to the world of open-source hardware was custom mechanical keyboards, which quickly transitioned into 3D Printing and Mechanical Design. Throughout this journey, software has always been at the forefront - from Python and Data Analysis, to my more recent focus on Web Development. Iâ€™m always looking for exciting projects, so please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you would like to work together!
